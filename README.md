# Deliveboo

### Deliveboo is a food delivery web app that allows customers to order from their favorite restaurant (helped also by filters and searchbar) without registration, but entering only the data necessary for delivery. Restaurateurs can register in the platform and create, modify and delete dishes based also on the statistics displayed in the personal area.
